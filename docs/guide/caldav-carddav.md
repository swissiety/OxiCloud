# CalDAV & CardDAV

OxiCloud provides built-in CalDAV (calendar) and CardDAV (contacts) servers — no extra apps or plugins needed.

## Authentication

CalDAV and CardDAV clients authenticate with an **app password**, not
your regular OxiCloud account password. Your account password is
refused on `/caldav/` and `/carddav/` (same as `/webdav/`). This is by
design — app passwords are the only credential shape that works
uniformly across all account types (password, magic-link-only, OIDC).

**Generate one:** in OxiCloud web UI, go to **Profile → App Passwords**,
click *Create*, name it (e.g. "Thunderbird calendar"), and copy the
token shown once. Use your username + that token in every DAV client
below.

See [DAV Client Setup](./dav-client-setup#before-you-start-get-an-app-password)
for full details.

## CalDAV (Calendars)

### Endpoint

```
https://your-server:8086/caldav/
```

### Protocol Compliance

- RFC 4791 (Calendar Access)
- RFC 5545 (iCalendar format)
- DAV capabilities: `1, 2, calendar-access`

### Route Structure

CalDAV is mounted at the top level, not under `/api`:

- `/caldav`
- `/caldav/`
- `/caldav/{*path}`

OxiCloud also exposes `/.well-known/caldav` and redirects it to `/caldav/`.

Typical resource shapes:

- `/caldav/` for the calendar home
- `/caldav/{calendar_id}/` for one calendar
- `/caldav/{calendar_id}/{ical_uid}.ics` for one event

### Supported Methods

- `OPTIONS`
- `PROPFIND`
- `REPORT`
- `MKCALENDAR`
- `PUT`
- `GET`
- `DELETE`
- `PROPPATCH`

### Client Setup
