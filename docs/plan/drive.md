## Context

Today every resource (folder, file) in OxiCloud has a single user owner
recorded directly on the row (`storage.folders.user_id`,
`storage.files.user_id`). Sharing is layered on top via ReBAC grants in
`storage.access_grants`. The model is simple and has carried us this far,
but it has two structural problems:

1. **Owner = user, full stop.** When a user leaves the company, their
   files leave with them. The team's de-facto shared folders are
   technically owned by a single person; transferring ownership requires
   moving every resource one-by-one and re-issuing every grant. There is
   no "this folder belongs to the Engineering team" concept.

2. **Quota is per-user, full stop.** A user with personal storage who
   also collaborates in a 1 TB team space currently has both counted
   against their personal quota (or the team data costs are absorbed by
   whoever owns the folder). There is no way to bill team storage to the
   team.

The proposal is to introduce **drives** as a Google-Workspace-style
container concept:

- Every resource belongs to exactly one drive.
- A drive has owners (users **and/or** groups) with roles.
- Each user automatically gets a personal drive at registration.
- Shared drives can be owned by groups, so membership changes
  automatically follow the group — "Bob left" no longer needs an admin
  to chase down which folders to reassign.
- Quotas move from users to drives.
- Per-drive policies enable team-level rules (forbid public links,
  forbid sharing, forbid cross-drive moves, future: timeboxed sessions,
  end-to-end encryption).

The shift is large but the model is well-understood — it's the same
pattern Google Workspace's Shared Drives and Microsoft SharePoint
Document Libraries use. OxiCloud users coming from those services will
recognise it instantly.

## Prerequisite — PR D-Prep: `access_grants → role_grants`

**Ratified 2026-06-16.** A separate PR lands BEFORE D0 that refactors
`storage.access_grants` into `storage.role_grants` with role-bundle
semantics:

```sql
storage.role_grants
    id            uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()
    subject_type  text NOT NULL CHECK (subject_type IN ('user','group'))
    subject_id    uuid NOT NULL
    resource_type text NOT NULL  -- 'folder','file','drive','group',…
    resource_id   uuid NOT NULL
    role          text NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('viewer','editor','owner', …))
    expires_at    timestamptz NULL
    granted_by    uuid NOT NULL FK → auth.users(id)
    granted_at    timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
```

Roles map to permission bundles via a single
server-side function `role_bundle(role) -> &[Permission]`:

| Role | Bundle |
|---|---|
| `viewer` | `Read` |
| `editor` | `Read, Create, Update, Comment` |
| `owner` | `Read, Create, Update, Comment, Delete, Share, Manage` |

`Manage` is a new Permission introduced in this refactor — covers
"configure this resource's settings, add/remove members, change role
assignments". Future-friendly for Group-as-Resource.

**Why first**:
1. Refactor has standalone value beyond Drive (cleaner API, audit
   log, UI surface).
2. Doing it AFTER Drive would force migrating both `access_grants`
   AND `drive_members` — solving the unification first means D0
   migrates one table, not two.
3. **The `drive_members` table planned by earlier drafts goes away.**
   Drive membership becomes rows in `role_grants` with
   `resource_type='drive'`. One table, one engine, one cache.

**The sections below describe the Drive model assuming D-Prep has
landed.** References to "drive membership" mean rows in
`role_grants` with `resource_type='drive'`, not a separate table.

**Gating policy**: D-Prep must ship, bake in production, and pass
validation across the API surface (grant endpoints, audit log
events) and the UI surface (My Shares dialog, share modals, admin
group/role views) before any of the Drive PRs (D0–D7) begin. The
goal is to surface and absorb refactor-related issues against the
existing single-resource model — not to discover them mid-flight
while the Drive migration is also in motion. If D-Prep needs
follow-up patches after deploy, they land as standalone fixes
before D0 starts.

## Locked design (decisions ratified in design discussion)

### 1. Ownership pivot

- A new table `storage.drives` becomes the ownership anchor.
- `storage.folders` and `storage.files` lose their `user_id` column;
  they gain `drive_id NOT NULL`.
- The owner of a resource is computed via `resource.drive_id →
  drive.drive_members WHERE role='owner'` — a JOIN, not a denormalised
  column. The drives table will be tiny (one row per internal user +
  handful of shared drives), so the join is cheap with a proper index.
- **Single source of truth** confirmed. `user_id` is dropped from
  resources after a migration phase (see Migration below).

### 2. Drive membership

Drive membership lives in `storage.role_grants` (introduced by PR
D-Prep — see prerequisite above) with `resource_type='drive'` and
`resource_id=<drive uuid>`. There is **no** separate
`drive_members` table. One row per `(subject, drive)` pair carries
the role; the role expands to a permission bundle via the same
`role_bundle()` function used everywhere else.

Concretely, a drive membership is:

```sql
INSERT INTO storage.role_grants
       (subject_type, subject_id, resource_type, resource_id, role, granted_by)
VALUES ('user',       $user_id,   'drive',       $drive_id,   'editor', $admin_id);
```

The `PgAclEngine` reads this row no differently than any other
grant; the drive-membership concept exists only at the application
layer (`DriveService` enforces the personal-drive invariants, etc.)
— there's no separate engine path or cache keyspace.

- A **shared** drive (`kind='shared'`) can have **0..N user
  owners + 0..N group owners** (mixed freely) plus any number of
  editors/viewers.
- A **personal** drive (`kind='personal'`) has exactly **one**
  member row in `drive_members`, fixed to `(subject_type='user',
  subject_id=<the user>, role='owner')`. The rule applies to
  every `kind='personal'` row, whether it carries
  `default_for_user IS NOT NULL` (the user's default drive) or
  `default_for_user IS NULL` (a secondary personal silo, e.g. a
  SQL-created sibling root folder promoted by migration §10).
  Secondary does **not** loosen the single-user constraint.
  - Personal drives **cannot** be added to, role-changed, or have
    their sole owner removed. They cannot be co-owned. They cannot
    be transferred to another user. This matches Google Drive's
    "My Drive" and Microsoft's "OneDrive" semantics: a personal
    drive is a single-user namespace; collaboration happens through
    per-resource grants, by moving content into a shared drive,
    or by promoting a secondary personal drive to `kind='shared'`
    (capability matrix in §3).
  - Enforcement is at the application layer:
    `DriveService::add_member` refuses when `kind='personal'`;
    `remove_member` refuses when the drive is personal. User
    deletion cleans up the user's **default** personal drive via
    the `default_for_user` FK cascade, and the user's
    **secondary** personal drives via an application-layer pass
    (those have no FK to cascade through — see §6 lifecycle).
- **Shared-drive last-owner protection**: removing the final
  `role='owner'` member of a shared drive is refused at the
  application layer. The check counts remaining owner-role members
  (expanding group owners to their members) and rejects the delete
  if the count would become zero.
- A shared drive can have **0 viewers** and **0 editors** — only
  the ≥1-owner invariant matters.

### 3. Drive entity

```sql
storage.drives
    id                uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()
    name              text NOT NULL                       -- "Personal" or user-chosen
    kind              text NOT NULL CHECK (kind IN ('personal','shared'))
    default_for_user  uuid NULL FK → auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
    quota_bytes       bigint NULL                         -- NULL = unlimited
    used_bytes        bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
    policies          jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'
    created_at        timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
    updated_at        timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
    -- `default_for_user` may ONLY be set on personal drives.
    -- Shared drives have it NULL by definition.
    CONSTRAINT drives_default_marker_personal_only
        CHECK (default_for_user IS NULL OR kind = 'personal')

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX drives_default_for_user_idx
    ON storage.drives (default_for_user)
    WHERE default_for_user IS NOT NULL;  -- one DEFAULT personal drive per user
```

#### Two orthogonal properties: `kind` and `default_for_user`

- **`kind`** = drive capability shape (see §2 for the rules):
  - `'personal'` = single-user single-owner; cannot have members
    added; sharing happens only through per-resource grants.
  - `'shared'` = multi-owner / multi-member; supports user and
    group members at every role.
- **`default_for_user`** = "this is the default drive for user
  X". Set on exactly one `kind='personal'` drive per user (the
  partial unique index enforces it). Used by:
  - UI default-drive redirect (`/` → `/drive/<default>`).
  - NC default-drive resolution when the credential doesn't pin
    a specific drive.
  - The `ON DELETE CASCADE` on this column cleans up the user's
    default drive in one step when the user is deleted.
  - Canonical lookup: `SELECT id FROM storage.drives WHERE
    default_for_user = $1` — single-row, index-backed.

A user can have **multiple `kind='personal'` drives** — at most
one of them carries `default_for_user`, the others sit as
"secondary personal" silos (e.g. SQL-created root folders
promoted by migration §10). Secondary personals follow the same
single-owner rules as the default; they just aren't the default
landing target.

External users **never** get a personal drive (lifecycle §6).
There is no constraint to write — externals simply have no row
in `storage.drives` with `default_for_user = <their id>`, and
nothing tries to create one.

#### Drive naming — `name` is a label, identity lives in `kind` + `default_for_user`

`name` is owner-editable for every drive (personal or shared). A
user who renames their drive from "Personal" → "Ed's space" does
**not** stop having a personal drive, and does not stop having a
default. The `kind` flag + `default_for_user` pointer carry the
identity; the name is purely a display label.

Why this matters:
- UI and NC default-drive resolution MUST query on `kind` /
  `default_for_user`, never on `name = 'Personal'`. The latter
  would silently break the moment the user renames.
- The initial migration sets `name = 'Personal'` on the default
  personal drive for back-compat with the label users see today;
  further renames go through the normal drive-rename endpoint
  and persist on the same row. Secondary personal drives carry
  whatever name the sibling root folder had (e.g. `Archive`,
  `2024 Projects`).

#### Capabilities matrix

| Capability | `kind='personal'`, default (`default_for_user` set) | `kind='personal'`, secondary (`default_for_user IS NULL`) | `kind='shared'` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Membership shape | exactly 1 user-owner row | exactly 1 user-owner row | 0..N users + 0..N groups at any role |
| `add_member` | refused | refused | allowed |
| `remove_member` | refused (sole owner is fixed) | refused (sole owner is fixed) | allowed except sole owner |
| Rename | allowed (by the owner) | allowed (by the owner) | allowed (by any owner) |
| Delete via API | **refused** — deleting this loses all the user's files; the only path is user-delete cascade | allowed (it's just a silo) | allowed (by an owner; CASCADEs the drive's contents) |
| Default-drive lookup result | this drive | never | never |
| On user-delete | `ON DELETE CASCADE` via `default_for_user` FK (free) | application-layer cleanup: enumerate via drive_members and delete | member rows referencing the user are dropped; refuse user-delete if any shared drive would lose its last owner |
| Group ownership | no | no | yes |
| Per-resource grant outward | yes (subject to drive policies) | yes | yes |
| Cross-drive move | yes (subject to `forbid_cross_drive_move`) | yes | yes |
| Kind conversion | no — always default-personal | yes → may be promoted to `kind='shared'` later (drops the single-user restriction, picks up members) | no |

### 4. Roles → permission bundles

Drive-level roles map to existing ReBAC `Permission` values via union
expansion:

| Role | Permissions implied on every resource inside the drive |
|---|---|
| `viewer` | `Read` |
| `editor` | `Read`, `Create`, `Update`, `Comment` |
| `owner`  | `Read`, `Create`, `Update`, `Comment`, `Delete`, `Share`, *and* drive-level admin (rename, edit policies, manage members, change quota) |

### 5. Permission resolution — additive over `role_grants`

A user has permission `P` on resource `R` if any of the
`role_grants` rows reachable from them (directly, via group
membership, or via drive membership) carries a role whose bundle
includes `P`. Specifically:

- A direct grant: `(subject_type='user', subject_id=$user, resource_id=$R, role=…)`
- A group-mediated grant: any `role_grants` row whose
  `subject_type='group'` points at a group the user is a transitive
  member of.
- A drive-mediated grant: any `role_grants` row whose
  `resource_type='drive'` and `resource_id=$R.drive_id`, with
  the same per-row role bundle.

Permissions are **additive**. Drive role is the baseline floor for
every resource in the drive; explicit per-resource grants only add
on top. There is no "revoke for this file even though you're a
drive editor" concept, matching Google Workspace.

The auth engine reads `role_grants` as a single source of truth.
Cache invalidation has one keyspace (rows in `role_grants`) instead
of two. The drive-membership lookup ("what drives can this caller
read?") is a `WHERE subject_id=$1 AND resource_type='drive'` scan
against the same table.

### 6. Lifecycle rules

| Event | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| New internal user registers | Auto-create a default personal drive (`kind='personal'`, `name='Personal'`, `default_for_user=<new_user>`, `quota_bytes=<OXICLOUD_DEFAULT_QUOTA_BYTES>`), insert the single `drive_members (drive_id, user, <user_id>, owner)` row. |
| External user invited (magic-link only) | **No personal drive created.** External users are grant-only recipients with no storage. |
| External user converts to internal (future flow) | Default personal drive created at conversion time. |
| User deleted | **Default** personal drive cascade-deletes via `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `default_for_user`. **Secondary** personal drives (`kind='personal' AND default_for_user IS NULL` and whose sole `drive_members` row points at the user) are deleted by an application-layer pass in the same transaction. Member rows referencing the deleted user are removed from all shared drives. If a removal would leave a shared drive with zero owners, deletion is refused — admin must transfer first. |
| Group deleted | Refuse if the group is a member of any shared drive that would lose its last owner. Admin must transfer or remove the group's role from those drives first. (Groups can't be members of personal drives.) |
| Add member to personal drive | Refuse. Personal drives are single-user — collaborate via per-resource grants or by moving content into a shared drive. |
| Remove sole owner of personal drive | Refuse. The only deletion path for a personal drive is user-deletion via cascade. |
| Delete personal drive | Refuse from the API. Only ON DELETE CASCADE (user deletion) drops it. |
| Rename personal or shared drive | Allowed for any owner-role caller. `name` is a label only. |
| Remove last owner of shared drive | Refuse — drive must always have ≥1 owner. App-layer check on `DELETE FROM drive_members`. |

### 7. Quota model

The per-user `auth.users.storage_quota_bytes` field is **migrated to
the user's personal drive's `quota_bytes`** in one step, then the
column is deprecated (kept for one release cycle as a no-op, dropped
in a later migration).

After the cutover:
- Every drive owns its quota. Files inside a drive count against that
  drive's `used_bytes` only.
- A user who collaborates in a 1 TB shared drive sees their personal
  drive's quota as "their" quota; the shared drive's quota is owned
  by the team.
- New drives default to a tenant-configured `OXICLOUD_DEFAULT_DRIVE_QUOTA_BYTES`
  setting (separate env var, replacing today's per-user equivalent).

`used_bytes` is maintained incrementally on every file insert/delete
(plus a periodic reconciliation job to fix drift, similar to the
existing per-user accounting).

**Chunk dedup vs per-drive quota.** With the CDC chunk store landed
in v0.7.0 (see `delta_upload_service`, `upload_ingest`, instant
upload by hash), a single chunk can be referenced by files in
multiple drives. The accounting decision: **each drive counts the
file's logical size in full against its own `used_bytes`** — dedup
savings are server-side only and never visible in the per-drive
quota number. This matches the existing per-user blob-dedup model
and avoids the alternative "pro-rated quota" trap (which makes
quota math depend on cross-drive content and breaks the user's
mental model of "I have 1 TB free"). Reconciliation job sums file
sizes per drive, not chunk allocations.

### 8. Policies (JSONB, extensible)

Each drive carries a `policies` JSON object. Five known keys for v1:

```jsonc
{
    "forbid_sharing":           false,  // disables per-resource grants on this drive
    "forbid_external_sharing":  false,  // blocks grants to is_external=true subjects
    "forbid_public_links":      false,  // blocks token-share (anonymous link) creation
    "forbid_cross_drive_move":  false   // blocks MOVE when src.drive_id != dst.drive_id
}
```

Enforcement points (one place per policy — single grep target):

| Policy | Enforcement callsite |
|---|---|
| `forbid_sharing` | `grant_handler::create_grant` — checks `resource.drive_id`'s policy before insertion |
| `forbid_external_sharing` | `magic_link_invite_service::resolve_or_create_recipient` and `grant_handler::create_grant` (when subject is `is_external=true`) |
| `forbid_public_links` | `share_handler::create_shared_link` |
| `forbid_cross_drive_move` | `file_handler::move_file` and `folder_handler::move_folder` — refuse when `src.drive_id != dst.drive_id` |

Default to `false` (everything allowed) — opt-in by drive owner via
the drive settings UI.

#### Policy semantics — subtleties to remember

- **`forbid_sharing`** disables **per-resource** grants on resources
  in the drive. Drive owners can still add **drive-level** members
  (otherwise the drive becomes uneditable except by the original
  owner). The policy means "no fine-grained sharing of individual
  files; access happens through drive membership only".
- **`forbid_cross_drive_move`** protects against exfiltration via UI
  move. It does **not** stop download + re-upload (that's a different
  category of policy — file-egress, future). UI surface should make
  this explicit so users don't read it as data-leak protection.

#### Future policy keys (out of scope for v1 — but the JSONB shape
accommodates them without schema migration)

- `timeboxed_session` — drive contents require re-auth after N
  minutes. Significant UX/middleware lift; defer.
- `end_to_end_encrypted` — client-side encryption; massive scope.

### 9. URL surface

#### Frontend

| URL | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `/` | Redirect to the caller's personal drive UUID |
| `/drive/<drive-uuid>` | Drive root view |
| `/drive/<drive-uuid>/<folder-id>` | Folder inside the drive |

#### Native WebDAV (`/webdav/...`)

| URL | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `/webdav/<path>` | Caller's personal drive root + `<path>` (back-compat with today's behaviour) |
| `/webdav/drives/<drive-uuid>/<path>` | Specific drive root + `<path>` |

Today's `/webdav/<path>` handler implicitly looks up the caller's
home folder and prepends it. Post-drives, the same handler looks up
the caller's personal drive and resolves paths inside it. **Zero
breakage** for existing native WebDAV clients.

The `drives` path segment is **reserved**: a folder literally named
`drives` cannot exist at the top level of any drive. Migration
pre-check refuses to start if existing data violates this — operator
must rename before upgrading. (Conservative estimate: zero existing
folders are named exactly `drives`. The migration script reports any
collisions for manual fix-up.)

#### NextCloud-compat WebDAV (`/remote.php/dav/...`)

> **The path-segment `/drives/<uuid>/` form is NOT used on the NC
> surface.** It is reserved for the native WebDAV surface (see
> table above). The NC surface keeps the URL shape
> `/remote.php/dav/files/<username>/<path>` and carries the drive
> selector in the **credential**, not the URL.
>
> NC desktop / mobile clients store credentials per
> `(host, username)` and offer a single sync root per saved
> account. A path-segment scheme would require NC clients to grow
> multi-root awareness, which they don't have. Two
> credential-side mechanisms are valid here:
>
> 1. **Username discriminator (`{user}~{drive-uuid}`)** — the
>    chroot POC on `feat/nextcloud-drive` (commit `137169b7`).
>    The Basic Auth username carries the drive UUID after a `~`
>    separator; the URL stays under `/remote.php/dav/files/{user}~{uuid}/<path>`.
>    Explicit on the wire, no per-credential server state needed
>    beyond the existing app-password row.
>
> 2. **App-password ↔ drive binding** — store the chosen drive
>    UUID directly on the `auth.app_passwords` row at issuance
>    time. The Basic Auth username stays as `{user}` (clean
>    NextCloud UX, no `~` to explain). The auth middleware looks
>    up the app-password row, reads its `drive_id` binding, and
>    uses that as the drive context. Each drive a user wants to
>    sync gets its own app-password.
>
> Both are workable; option (2) is the cleaner UX (username
> matches what users type, no extra character to explain) but
> requires a schema add on `auth.app_passwords` and one extra
> JOIN in the hot auth path. Option (1) is the smallest possible
> change but exposes the `~` to the user. They're not mutually
> exclusive — the issuance flow can produce credentials in either
> shape. Decide before D1 ships which is the **default** the
> Login Flow v2 picker produces.

| URL | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `/remote.php/dav/files/<username>/<path>` | That user's personal drive — unchanged. (App-password drive-binding NULL ⇒ personal.) |
| `/remote.php/dav/files/<username>~<drive-uuid>/<path>` | Option 1: explicit drive in the URL. |
| `/remote.php/dav/files/<username>/<path>` *(with `auth.app_passwords.drive_id` set)* | Option 2: drive resolved from the credential row. URL is indistinguishable from the unchanged personal case to the client. |

In either case, the auth middleware asserts the caller is a member
of the resolved drive before serving any DAV verb. Pre-existing NC
clients pointed at `/remote.php/dav/files/<username>/` continue
syncing the user's personal drive without reconfiguration —
regardless of which option is chosen as the default.

#### Username/UUID collision — defused

The `/remote.php/dav/files/<x>/` vs `/remote.php/dav/drives/<x>/`
split solves the worry about username/UUID ambiguity. The
discriminator is the literal segment (`files` vs `drives`), never
the value of `<x>`. A user happening to have a UUID-shaped username
is no longer a problem.

### 10. Storage paths — wrapper folder retired

Today `storage.folders.path` is e.g. `My Folder - admin/Docs`. The
"My Folder - admin" wrapper is the user's home folder, created at
registration via `format!("My Folder - {}", username)`.

Post-drives, **the wrapper goes away**. The drive itself is the
root; folders and files that used to live inside the wrapper sit
directly under the drive with no intermediate folder:

```
Drive "Personal" (uuid=…, kind=personal, owner=admin) ← was the "My Folder - admin" wrapper
├── Docs/
└── aa.pdf
```

Same for shared drives — they already had no wrapper:

```
Drive "Engineering" (uuid=…, kind=shared, owners=group:engineering)
├── Specs/
├── Roadmap.md
└── archive/
```

The two surfaces share one rule: **drive root = `parent_id IS NULL`
within the drive's `drive_id`**. The "personal vs shared" branch
disappears from path resolution — both kinds resolve the same way.

#### Why this is client-safe

The wrapper was already invisible to WebDAV / NC clients pre-drive:

- NC clients hit `/remote.php/dav/files/<user>/<path>` and
  `nc_to_internal_path` prepended `My Folder - <user>/` internally
  before talking to the storage layer. The client never saw the
  wrapper segment in its URL.
- Native `/webdav/<path>` was implicitly chrooted to the user's
  home by `resolve_webdav_path`. Same story.

So URL-level back-compat is preserved trivially — clients keep
asking for `/remote.php/dav/files/admin/Docs/foo.pdf`, the
resolver no longer prepends the wrapper, and the storage row's
path is now `Docs/foo.pdf` instead of `My Folder - admin/Docs/foo.pdf`.
Net effect on the wire: zero.

#### Why this is a better model

The original plan kept the wrapper "for back-compat" but it has
no value beyond the storage layer (clients never see it, the
filesystem mirror is happy either way). Keeping it forced path
resolution to always know whether the caller is in a personal or
shared drive and conditionally prepend a segment. Dropping it
collapses that branch and makes the personal-vs-shared distinction
purely a metadata concern (kind, quota source, member shape) —
**not** a path-shape concern.

#### Sibling root folders also become drives

Today the only way to get a `parent_id IS NULL` folder is via the
home-folder creation path, which produces exactly one per user.
However, manual SQL has already been used (and may still be used
by ops) to create additional top-level folders — folders that sit
beside `My Folder - <user>` at `parent_id IS NULL`. These are
**not** addressable today through any handler (the UI assumes
exactly one root); they exist as data only.

Post-migration, the model has to absorb them. Rule:

- For each user, find every row with `parent_id IS NULL AND user_id
  = <this user>`.
- The one named `My Folder - <username>` becomes the **default
  personal drive**: `kind='personal'`,
  `default_for_user=<user>`, sole member = the user.
- Every **other** sibling becomes a fresh **secondary personal
  drive**: `kind='personal'`, `default_for_user=NULL`, sole
  member = the user, name carried over from the folder's `name`
  column, quota initialised from the user's quota
  (`auth.users.storage_quota_bytes`) — same default as the
  user's primary personal drive. Membership rules from §2 apply:
  the user cannot invite co-owners while the drive remains
  personal. To open the silo up, the user can later **convert**
  the secondary personal to `kind='shared'` (an
  application-layer operation that flips the kind and lifts the
  single-user restriction so the membership API can add other
  users / groups).
- The folder row is deleted (the drive replaces it as the root).
  Its children get their `parent_id` set to `NULL` *within their
  new `drive_id`*.

The chroot POC's "pick a drive at login" picker on
`feat/nextcloud-drive` already produces the right shape for this:
users with one drive auto-select Personal silently, users with
N drives get a real picker. No POC change needed — it just sees
real drive rows instead of folder UUIDs.

### 11. Content search index — drive-aware filtering

v0.7.0 added an embedded Tantivy full-text content index (see
`infrastructure/services/search_index/tantivy_content_index.rs`
and migration `20260701000000_content_search_index.sql`). Today
every indexed document carries the owning user as a filter field
and queries restrict by that field at query time.

When ownership pivots to `drive_id`, the index has to follow —
otherwise search leaks content across drives the moment D7 drops
`user_id`:

1. **Schema update**: every indexed document gains a `drive_id`
   field stamped at ingest time. Existing documents need a
   one-shot reindex pass during the D0 migration (read each row,
   look up its new `drive_id`, update the index entry). Cheap on
   small instances; the migration script should report a progress
   count for larger ones.
2. **Query path**: instead of filtering by `user_id = caller`,
   expand `caller → set of drive_ids the caller can read`
   (personal + every shared-drive membership) and filter by
   `drive_id ∈ that set`. Expansion reuses the drive-role check
   already required by `PgAclEngine`.
3. **Treat as a blocking step of D0**, not a D4/D5-era polish
   item — otherwise the index is the silent leak path during the
   dual-write window.

Filtering on a low-cardinality `drive_id` is something Tantivy
handles natively; this is bookkeeping, not a query-plan risk.

### 12. Trash — per-drive scoped, owner-actioned

Today trash is per-user: `storage.files` / `storage.folders`
carry `is_trashed BOOLEAN` + `trashed_at` + `original_parent_id`
(soft-delete in place), and `storage.trash_items` is a VIEW that
UNIONs them. The listing endpoint (`GET /api/trash/resources`)
filters by `user_id = caller`.

Post-drives, trash becomes **per-drive**:

- **Storage shape is unchanged.** The `drive_id` column added to
  `storage.files` / `storage.folders` in Phase A already
  identifies which drive a trashed row belongs to. No new
  trash table, no schema work beyond updating the
  `storage.trash_items` VIEW to surface `drive_id` alongside
  (or replacing) `user_id`.
- **Trash listing query** filters by drive(s) the caller can
  read. Default listing returns trash from every drive the
  caller has membership on; a `?drive_id=<uuid>` parameter
  scopes to one drive. UI shows a drive picker above the trash
  list, same as the main file view.
- **Trash mutations are owner-only.** Per the §4 role-bundle,
  `Delete` is in the owner bundle only — so today's "anyone
  who can delete the original can act on its trash entry" is
  already drive-owner-scoped. Specifically:
  - **Send to trash** — any drive owner (carries `Delete`).
    Personal drive: the user themselves.
  - **Restore** — any drive owner. Operation reverses
    `is_trashed`, sets `parent_id` back to `original_parent_id`
    when that ancestor is still in the same drive (otherwise to
    the drive root with a name conflict resolver).
  - **Permanent delete** — any drive owner. Clears the row and
    decrements drive `used_bytes`.
  - **View trash** — any drive member (viewer / editor /
    owner). Viewers can see what was deleted from a drive they
    have access to; only owners can act on it. Mirrors Google
    Drive's per-shared-drive trash UX.
- **Cross-drive moves carry their trash home with them**:
  when a file moves from drive A → drive B and is later
  trashed, the row's `drive_id` is B's, so trash for B sees
  it (not A's, which is the natural and expected answer).
- **Cascade on drive deletion**: when a shared drive is
  deleted (D3 will land the delete-drive flow), every
  `storage.files` / `storage.folders` row with that
  `drive_id` cascades, trashed or not. There's no need to
  "drain the trash first" — the whole drive disappears in
  one CASCADE.
- **Personal-drive trash** follows the same model: bound to
  the personal drive, sole owner (= the user) does
  everything. No new UX divergence between personal and
  shared.

The orphan/aborted-upload sweep introduced in v0.7.0
(`944c8337`, periodic trash job) must become drive-aware so
it doesn't accidentally sweep across drives the caller
shouldn't see. It already keys off ownership; the rewrite is
a per-drive pass instead of per-user.

### 13. Upload paths and quota timing

Four upload protocols, each with different "when do we know the
size" and "when do we know the destination" answers. The Drive
migration pivots quota from user-scoped to drive-scoped without
changing protocol shapes — but one path (NC chunked) carries a
pre-existing wart that the chroot POC's `~` username (or the
`app_passwords.drive_id` binding) lets us finally fix.

| Protocol | Size known | Quota check fires | Destination / drive known |
|---|---|---|---|
| Default multipart (`POST /api/files/upload`) | At request start (Content-Length / multipart `size`). | `file_upload_service.rs:185` — `check_storage_quota(caller_id, metadata.size)` before any bytes are stored. | At request start (form field `folder_id`). Drive derives from `folder.drive_id`. |
| Native chunked (`POST /api/uploads`) | At session create — client declares `total_size` in JSON. | `chunked_upload_handler.rs:213` — at session creation against declared `total_size`. | At session creation (`folder_id` in JSON). Drive derives from `folder.drive_id`. |
| **NextCloud chunked** (`/remote.php/dav/uploads/{user}/{session}/...`) | Never declared. MKCOL creates empty session, PUT chunks arrive one at a time, client decides "done". | **Today: only at the final MOVE (assemble)** — `handle_assemble` → `file_upload_service::ingest_stream_to_cas` → quota check on the assembled size. Wasted-bandwidth wart: a client over quota can upload GB before the server can refuse. | **Today**: only at MOVE (parsed from the `Destination:` header). **With the chroot POC** (`{user}~{drive-uuid}` username, see §9): known at MKCOL — the auth middleware already split the username. **With `app_passwords.drive_id` binding**: known at MKCOL — the credential row pins the drive. |
| Delta protocol (`/api/files/delta/*`) | At `negotiate` (client provides manifest with `total_size`). | `delta_upload_service.rs:331` — at commit against `total_size`. | At negotiate (target file_id or `folder_id`). Drive derives accordingly. |

#### Decision — per-chunk incremental quota check on the NC chunked path

The three non-NC paths trivially pivot to drive-scoped quota:
replace `check_storage_quota(caller_id, size)` with
`check_drive_quota(drive_id, size)`. Destination is known at
handler entry; drive falls out of the destination's `drive_id`
column. No protocol change.

For NC chunked, the Drive migration **also closes the
wasted-bandwidth wart** because the drive identity is now known
at MKCOL (via `~` username or app-password binding — either NC
credential-side scheme from §9 surfaces it). Approach:

1. **MKCOL guard** — if `drive.used_bytes >= drive.quota_bytes`,
   refuse the session creation with `507 Insufficient Storage`.
   No point letting the client even start.
2. **Per-chunk PUT check** — track cumulative bytes received in
   the session (sum of on-disk chunk sizes, maintained by the
   chunked-uploads service). On each PUT, before writing the
   chunk:
   ```text
   if drive.used_bytes + session.bytes_so_far + chunk.size > drive.quota_bytes:
       refuse with 507 Insufficient Storage
   ```
   The first chunk that would push us over is refused; client
   sees the error within one chunk's worth of wasted upload
   (typically a few MB) instead of after the whole multi-GB file.
3. **Assemble-time re-check** stays as a defence-in-depth (in
   case two concurrent sessions on the same drive each got past
   the per-chunk check but their sum exceeds quota at MOVE). This
   matches today's structure.
4. **Unlimited quota** (`quota_bytes IS NULL`) short-circuits all
   three checks — no work.

The per-chunk check is O(1) amortised: each session tracks its
cumulative size as it goes. The drive's `used_bytes` is read from
the row once per chunk; with the v0.7.0 incremental-update
pattern (`b5b80549`, `d6987329`) that's a single primary-key
lookup, not an aggregate query.

Net effect on NC clients: nothing changes for in-quota uploads;
over-quota clients get a clear 507 within seconds instead of
after the whole upload finishes.

#### Editor-role delete and trash — call out the UX tension

§4's role bundle gives `Delete` only to `owner`. That means
in a shared drive, an editor who uploads a typo file CANNOT
send it to trash themselves — they have to ask an owner. This
is already flagged as Open Question 4 (revisit before D2) and
the answer there determines the trash UX for editors too. If
editors get a `Delete` capability (or a dedicated "trash own
content" capability), the trash mutation rules become "trash
your own files" + "drive owners can act on anyone's trashed
files". Until that's decided, the conservative answer above
(owner-only mutations) holds.

### 14. File provenance — `created_by` / `updated_by`

Today `storage.files.user_id` (and `storage.folders.user_id`)
quietly doubles as **both** the ownership pointer (whose files are
these?) AND the provenance signal (who created this?). The Drive
migration cleanly separates ownership onto `drive_id`, but
provenance has to come with us — in a shared drive where Ed,
Alice, and Bob all upload files, "who put this here?" remains a
load-bearing question for UI, audit, and account-cleanup workflows.

The split:

```sql
-- on both storage.folders and storage.files:
drive_id     uuid NOT NULL                       -- ownership
created_by   uuid NULL FK → auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
created_at   timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()  -- existing
updated_by   uuid NULL FK → auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
updated_at   timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()  -- existing
```

- **`created_by`** is set once at row insert (every upload path:
  multipart, native chunked, NC chunked, streaming CDC, delta,
  instant-upload-by-hash) — the caller_id stamps it. Never
  changes after.
- **`updated_by`** is set whenever `updated_at` is touched —
  rename, overwrite, move, restore from trash, PROPPATCH on
  favorites. Same write-path discipline as `updated_at` today.
- **`ON DELETE SET NULL`** on both FKs. When a user is deleted,
  files they created or edited in shared drives stay (they belong
  to the drive, not the deleter); the FK nulls out, the UI renders
  "Unknown user" (or "Deleted user" with a small tombstone table —
  future polish, see Open Question 12).

#### Why this lands in D0, not D7

If we waited until D7 to introduce these columns, every existing
file/folder row would have NULL `created_by` after the migration —
provenance permanently lost for pre-D7 content. Adding the columns
in D0 and **backfilling from `user_id`** during the dual-write
phase gives every existing row a real `created_by` value (the user
we know created it, because that's what `user_id` meant). New
writes during the dual-write window populate both `user_id` AND
`created_by` / `updated_by`. By D7 the columns are self-sufficient
and dropping `user_id` loses nothing.

#### UI display semantics

- File details panel: "Created by Alice on 2026-01-15", "Last
  edited by Bob 3 hours ago" — both fields drive a normal user
  avatar + name lookup. NULL → "Unknown user" placeholder.
- Activity log on a shared drive: aggregates `updated_by` over
  recent rows to show "who's been active here lately".
- Account-cleanup workflow: when an admin deletes a user, show a
  pre-flight summary "Bob authored 47 files and last edited 12
  more across drives X, Y, Z — proceeding will mark those entries
  as authored by 'Deleted user'." Lets the admin choose to
  reassign or simply confirm.

#### Engine touch-point

The "who touched updated_at" rule applies uniformly across all
mutation paths. Centralise it: every service that bumps
`updated_at` must also set `updated_by = caller_id` in the same
SQL statement. The `FileRepository::update_*` and
`FolderRepository::update_*` methods are the natural choke points
— a single audit reveals every callsite to verify.

The async `tree_etag_queue` (v0.7.0) propagates an etag up the
ancestry but **does NOT** propagate `updated_by` — ETags are
fingerprints of structure, not authorship. Only the direct
mutation site updates `updated_by`.

## Migration strategy

A drive-id column on every resource is a database surgery touching
every storage query. We phase it for safety:

### Phase A — additive (PR D0)

1. Create `storage.drives` and `storage.drive_members`.
2. Add `drive_id uuid NULL` to `storage.folders` and `storage.files`.
3. **Per-user root-folder sweep**: for each internal user, list
   every `storage.folders` row where `parent_id IS NULL AND
   user_id = <this user>`. Exactly one is expected to be
   `My Folder - <username>`; any extras are SQL-created siblings
   (see §10).
   - The `My Folder - <username>` row → becomes the **default
     personal drive**: `INSERT INTO storage.drives (name='Personal',
     kind='personal', default_for_user=<user>, quota_bytes=<user.storage_quota_bytes>)`
     and insert one `(drive_id, user=<user>, role='owner')`
     member row.
   - Every other sibling row → becomes a fresh **secondary
     personal drive**: `kind='personal'`, `default_for_user=NULL`,
     name carried over from the folder's `name`,
     `quota_bytes=<user.storage_quota_bytes>`, and one
     `(drive_id, user=<user>, role='owner')` member row.
     Membership rules from §2 apply (single-owner, no `add_member`);
     the user can later promote one to `kind='shared'` to invite
     collaborators.
4. **Promote children, drop the wrapper**: for every folder/file
   row that has `parent_id = <a root row from step 3>`, set
   `drive_id = <that root's new drive id>` and `parent_id = NULL`
   (the drive itself is the new root, not a folder). Then DELETE
   the root folder rows from step 3 — they no longer exist as
   folders, the drive replaces them.
5. **Cascade `drive_id` down the tree** — for every remaining
   folder/file row, set `drive_id` by walking the ancestry to
   whichever root the row descends from. After this step every
   row has the same `drive_id` as its `parent_id`'s row, which
   chains up to a drive set in step 3/4.
6. **Full path-metadata reconstruction**. The `path` column on
   **every** row in `storage.folders` and `storage.files` gets
   rewritten. For rows that descended from `My Folder - <username>`,
   strip that prefix; for rows that descended from a sibling root,
   strip that sibling's `name`. The path column now contains only
   the in-drive path (e.g. `Docs/foo.pdf`, never
   `My Folder - admin/Docs/foo.pdf`).
   - **This is the bulk of D0's runtime cost.** Personal-drive
     scope = every folder/file the user owns. A 100k-file user
     gets 100k UPDATEs. Use a single `UPDATE … WHERE drive_id =
     <id>` per drive, not a row-at-a-time loop. The ltree-path
     change is what every downstream subsystem keys off, so doing
     this in one transaction per drive (not per row) is also a
     correctness boundary.
   - **Downstream caches and indexes** — audit each for path or
     path-derived keys:
     - **Tantivy content index (§11)** — the index does NOT
       store paths (see `tantivy_content_index.rs`: indexed
       fields are `file_id`, `user_id`, `name` (basename only),
       `content`. No `path` field, the wrapper folder name was
       never a term). So the wrapper removal alone requires no
       reindex. The reindex §11 calls for is driven by the
       schema gaining `drive_id` and the query filter pivoting
       from `user_id` to `drive_id` — NOT by the path rewrite.
       Same migration window, but for a different reason.
     - **Thumbnail cache** — if keyed by path rather than
       file_id, invalidate; preferably switch to file_id-keyed
       during this migration so the issue doesn't recur. Audit
       before D0 starts.
     - **Folder ETag queue (`async_tree_etag_queue`,** see Open
       Question 8) — flush or recompute; ETags derived from old
       paths are stale.
     - **Recent-items / favorites** — referenced by file_id, not
       path; probably fine. Verify.
   - **On-disk storage mirror** — see Open Question 10. If the
     filesystem layout is path-mirrored, every file moves on
     disk too; if content-addressable, the FS is untouched.
     Audit before D0 starts.
7. Verify: every row has `drive_id IS NOT NULL`, no row has
   `parent_id` pointing at a non-existent folder, no `path` value
   contains the legacy `My Folder - ` prefix.
8. Add `NOT NULL` constraint on `drive_id`.

**Keep `user_id`** on resources alongside `drive_id` for the entire
Phase A release cycle. Code is updated to read `drive_id` everywhere;
`user_id` is dual-written for one release as a safety net. If
something breaks we can roll back without data loss.

Pre-flight checks the migration script runs before any writes:
- Report how many sibling-root folders exist per user. Don't
  refuse — extras become drives — but surface the count so an
  operator can sanity-check ("Ed has 4 root folders, expected
  ≤1; verify those are real and intended before promoting them
  to drives").
- Refuse if any sibling root folder is literally named `drives`
  (would collide with the reserved URL segment on the native
  `/webdav/drives/<uuid>/...` surface). Operator renames first.
- Refuse if any user has `storage_used_bytes > storage_quota_bytes`
  by an amount that wouldn't fit the destination drive's quota
  semantics (sanity check).

### Phase B — cleanup (PR D7, one release later)

1. Drop `user_id` from `storage.folders` and `storage.files`.
2. Drop dual-write code paths.
3. Deprecate `auth.users.storage_quota_bytes` (or drop — quotas live
   on drives now).

Phase B is the point of no return; deferring it by one release gives
us a real rollback window while the new model bakes in production.

## PR sequencing

| PR | Scope | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| **D-Prep — role_grants refactor** | `access_grants → role_grants` schema migration with role-bundle semantics. `Manage` Permission added to the enum + role bundle. Engine reads role_grants only; `access_grants` removed (after one dual-write release if compat is needed). API gains `role` parameter on grant endpoints; audit log emits one `role_grant.*` event per role assignment instead of N permission events. **No Drive concept yet.** Sets the foundation that all subsequent PRs build on. **Data shape confirmed**: empirical audit shows >99% of existing `access_grants` rows already cluster into the standard bundles (viewer/editor/owner) — the migration is mechanical for the vast majority of data; the <1% edge cases get absorbed by shipping `commenter` and `contributor` roles on day one or get an explicit per-row migration decision logged. | **Medium** — touches the load-bearing authorisation table, but the data shape removes the main migration risk |
| **D0 — foundation** | `storage.drives` schema (no `drive_members` — uses `role_grants` from D-Prep); `Drive` domain entity; migration creating personal drives + backfilling `drive_id` on every resource; read-only `GET /api/drives` listing the caller's drives (single query: `SELECT … FROM role_grants WHERE subject_id=$caller AND resource_type='drive'`). Dual-write `user_id` alongside `drive_id` for safety. **No new UI.** **Every upload path stamps `drive_id` at insert**: classic multipart (`file_handler::upload`), chunked NC (`uploads_handler`), streaming CDC (`upload_ingest`), delta upload (`delta_upload_service`), instant upload by hash. Tantivy reindex (see §11) is part of this PR. **Provenance columns added** (see §14): `created_by` and `updated_by` on both `storage.folders` and `storage.files`, FK to `auth.users` with `ON DELETE SET NULL`; backfilled from `user_id` so pre-Drive content has provenance from day one; every mutation path that touches `updated_at` also sets `updated_by`. | **High** — every storage query touches, all upload paths touched |
| **D1 — UI switcher + URL routing** | Sidebar drive picker, `/drive/<uuid>/<folder-id>` frontend routes, default-drive redirect from `/`. WebDAV path dispatcher recognising `drives/<uuid>` as the drive-explicit prefix on both `/webdav/` and `/remote.php/dav/`. | Medium |
| **D2 — drive membership API + per-drive trash auth** | `POST /api/drives/{id}/members`, `DELETE`, `PUT` for role changes — thin handlers that translate to `role_grants` INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE with `resource_type='drive'`. `Resource::Drive(Uuid)` (added in D-Prep at the enum level) gets its specialised handler surface here. Shared-drive last-owner protection. Group-as-subject support reuses the existing `subject_groups` machinery. **Personal-drive guards** (`add_member`, `remove_member`, `delete_drive` refuse on `kind='personal'` — see §2). **Per-drive trash authorisation** (§12): trash listing filters by drive(s) the caller can read; trash mutations (send/restore/permanent-delete) require `role='owner'` on the drive; `storage.trash_items` VIEW updated to surface `drive_id`; orphan/aborted-upload sweep becomes per-drive. | Medium |
| **D3 — group-owned shared drives** | "Create shared drive" flow — admin or group owner triggers, drive created with `kind='shared'`, initial owner row is the group. Group-deletion guard refuses if the group is the last owner of any drive. Drive-rename, drive-delete. | Low |
| **D4 — per-drive quota** | Move storage accounting off `auth.users.storage_used_bytes` onto `storage.drives.used_bytes`. **Re-point the existing per-user incremental CTE** (introduced in v0.7.0 — see `b5b80549`, `d6987329`) at drive rows; don't reinvent the counting logic. Upload paths check `drive.quota_bytes` instead of (or in addition to) the user's quota for the dual-write window. **Per-chunk incremental quota check on the NC chunked path** (see §13): MKCOL refuses when the drive is already over quota; each PUT chunk runs an O(1) `used + session_so_far + chunk_size > quota` test and refuses with 507 within one chunk of wasted upload. Closes a pre-existing wart where NC clients could upload GB before learning they were over quota. Reconciliation job runs once per day to fix drift. | Medium |
| **D5 — policies** | JSONB policies column + enforcement at the four known callsites. Owner-only UI in drive settings. Ship policies one at a time if you want fine-grained rollout — `forbid_public_links` first (lowest risk), then `forbid_external_sharing`, then `forbid_sharing`, then `forbid_cross_drive_move`. | Low |
| **D6 — cross-drive move + audit** | Move folder/file between drives (allowed by default; gated by `forbid_cross_drive_move` policy on the source drive). Audit events for every drive lifecycle event (`drive.created`, `drive.member_added`, `drive.member_removed`, `drive.policy_changed`, `drive.deleted`, `resource.moved_between_drives`). | Low |
| **D7 — back-compat sweep** | Drop `user_id` from `storage.folders` / `storage.files`. Drop dual-write code. Drop or deprecate `auth.users.storage_quota_bytes`. **Provenance columns (`created_by`, `updated_by`) stay** — they were populated from D0 and are now the sole source of authorship signal. | Low — but the point of no return |

Approximate total: 4–6 weeks of focused work, depending on test
coverage depth.

## Out of scope for v1 (worth noting so we don't accidentally invite scope creep)

- **Timeboxed session policy** — drives that auto-lock after N
  minutes. Big middleware lift.
- **End-to-end encryption policy** — client-side encryption with
  server holding only ciphertext. Massive scope.
- **Per-drive sync targets** — sync client design ("1 drive = 1
  target like 'family-computer'"). Schema-friendly today (drive has
  stable UUID), implementation is its own design.
- **Cross-drive search UI** — start with per-drive scoping. "Search
  everywhere" comes later.
- **Drive templates** — "create a drive pre-populated with these
  folders" is nice but not foundation work.
<!--
Per-drive trash was originally listed as deferred until D7. It is
now in-scope and ratified in §12 — moved into D2 (trash permission
checks become drive-role-aware once the membership API lands).
The storage cost is near-zero because trash is soft-delete-in-
place on `storage.files` / `storage.folders`, which already carry
`drive_id` after Phase A.
-->


## Open questions to revisit before D0 lands

1. **Naming of the default personal drive**.
   - Locked: "Personal" (i18n key, neutral, doesn't break on username
     rename).
   - But: should it be renameable by the user? Default-rename allowed?
     I'd say yes — drive name is just a label.

2. **`auth.users.storage_quota_bytes` — drop or keep?**
   - Drop entirely (cleanest).
   - Keep as the **default initial quota** for newly-created personal
     drives (so admins still have a single tunable).
   - I lean toward keep-as-default-initial.

3. **Can a user be a member of their own personal drive in more than one
   way?** (e.g. directly AND via a group they belong to)
   - Should the membership rows allow that? Or dedup?
   - Easy answer: allow; permission resolution naturally unions, so
     duplicate paths to the same role are idempotent.

4. **What happens when you DELETE a folder/file in a shared drive
   you have only editor role on?**
   - Today: ReBAC checks Delete permission on the resource.
   - With drives: editor role implies Create + Update + Comment but
     **not** Delete (per the role-bundle table above).
   - So editor cannot delete by default. Should they? Some teams want
     "editor can do anything except change drive settings". Worth a
     dedicated decision before D2 — possibly add a separate "can
     delete" toggle, or split editor into `editor` / `contributor`.

5. **Drive icons / colour customisation** — visual differentiator
   between drives in the sidebar. Out of scope for v1 but worth
   noting; the `drives` table can carry a small `display` JSONB column
   that accumulates this kind of cosmetic config without schema
   churn.

6. **WebDAV path resolution edge case**: when a user is a member of a
   shared drive and someone shares a single file inside it explicitly
   with them via a per-resource grant, what path do they see in their
   client?
   - The drive's path (they have access via membership), full stop.
   - Per-resource grants are additive; they don't create a separate
     "shared with me" listing for files that already live in a drive
     the user can access.
   - Confirm during D2 that this is what users expect.

7. **Search-everywhere from the file picker**. When a user goes to
   share a file, today the picker lists their own files. With drives,
   should the picker default to "current drive" or "all drives I have
   access to"? UX call, not a foundation decision.

8. **`async_tree_etag_queue` — drive-pinning assumption audit**.
   v0.7.0 introduced `migrations/20260626000000_tree_etag_statement_triggers.sql`
   + `20260627000000_async_tree_etag_queue.sql` for ETag
   propagation up folder ancestry. The queue likely keys off
   folder path / owner; before D0 starts, confirm it doesn't
   embed assumptions that fold `drive_id` away (e.g. computing
   ancestry across a path that crosses a drive boundary).
   5-minute audit to lock the question down.

9. **NC credential ↔ drive binding default**. Section 9 leaves
   open whether the Login Flow v2 picker defaults to issuing
   `{user}~{uuid}` Basic Auth usernames (option 1) or
   `auth.app_passwords.drive_id`-bound app-passwords (option 2)
   for non-personal drives. Decide before D1 ships; the answer
   determines whether `auth.app_passwords` gets a new column or
   not.

10. **On-disk storage mirror — does the file path under
    `OXICLOUD_STORAGE_PATH` change too?** Phase A step 6 strips
    the `My Folder - <username>/` prefix from `storage.folders.path`
    / `storage.files.path` columns. If the on-disk layout mirrors
    these paths (`<storage>/<user_id>/My Folder - admin/Docs/foo.pdf`),
    the migration also has to `mv` every file on disk. If on-disk
    is content-addressable (BLAKE3-keyed), the columns can be
    rewritten without touching the filesystem. **Audit the
    storage adapter before starting D0** and decide whether the
    migration script:
    - just renames the path columns (CAS layout — cheap), or
    - renames the path columns AND issues a `mv` per file
      (path-mirrored layout — expensive on big instances).
    The blob store is content-addressable as of v0.7.0 so most
    file content lives under `.blobs/<hash[..2]>/<hash>` and is
    already wrapper-agnostic; the concern is only the
    metadata-projection / thumbnail-cache trees if they're
    path-shaped.

11. **Promoting sibling root folders — UX after migration**.
    Users whose home was a single `My Folder - <username>` end
    up with one drive (Personal). Users with SQL-added siblings
    end up with multiple drives, one named per the original
    folder name. The drive name carries over verbatim — should
    the migration log who got more than one drive, so an
    operator can DM them and explain the new picker? Operational
    nicety, not a correctness concern.

12. **Deleted-user tombstone for provenance**. §14 sets
    `created_by` / `updated_by` to NULL when the referenced user
    is deleted (`ON DELETE SET NULL`). The UI then shows "Unknown
    user", which is correct but information-poor — for compliance
    / audit / "who left this?" purposes, a small `deleted_users`
    tombstone table (`id, last_known_username, deleted_at`) would
    let the UI render "Bob (deleted 2026-04-12)" instead of just
    "Unknown user". Out of scope for v1 but easy to add later
    without schema rework (NULL `created_by` stays NULL; a
    parallel lookup against the tombstone table on display).

## Existing code to reuse

- **ReBAC `Resource` enum** at `src/domain/services/authorization.rs:74`
  already has a tagged-union shape; adding `Drive(Uuid)` is one variant
  + `from_parts` arm + `type_str` arm.
- **ReBAC `Permission` enum** already has the bundle we need
  (`Read`, `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Share`, `Comment`). The
  role-to-bundle mapping for drives lives in a new `drive_role.rs`
  helper.
- **`PgAclEngine` Moka cache** at
  `src/infrastructure/services/pg_acl_engine.rs:88` handles ReBAC
  grant caching. The drive-role check piggybacks on the same cache
  with a separate keyspace (`drive_perm:<user>:<drive>:<perm>`).
- **`SubjectGroupService::list_transitive_users`** at
  `src/application/services/subject_group_service.rs:385` already
  expands a group to its transitive user members. The drive-membership
  check uses this to resolve group-owner subjects.
- **`folder_service::create_home_folder`** at
  `src/application/services/folder_service.rs:644` is where the
  per-user wrapper folder is created today. Post-migration this
  function **goes away** — there is no wrapper folder anymore. The
  user-create lifecycle hook now creates a Drive row directly and
  inserts the owner-role member row. The lifecycle path is the same;
  the work it does shrinks.
- **NC path resolver `nc_to_internal_path`** at
  `src/interfaces/nextcloud/webdav_handler.rs:51` and the native
  resolver `resolve_webdav_path` at
  `src/interfaces/api/handlers/webdav_handler.rs:188` are the two
  callsites that learn about drives. Both gain a "drive context"
  parameter resolved from the URL prefix (`/files/<u>/` or
  `{user}~{uuid}` for NC; `/webdav/` or `/webdav/drives/<uuid>/`
  for native). **Neither resolver prepends `My Folder - <user>/`
  anymore** — the storage path IS the in-drive path. Both
  functions also get simpler, not more complex, despite gaining
  the drive parameter (the personal-vs-shared branch is now a
  metadata lookup, not a path-shape decision).
- **`MagicLinkInviteService`** and the share-notification pipeline
  (`RecipientNotificationService`) need the new policy checks
  (`forbid_external_sharing`, `forbid_sharing`) wired in at their
  respective callsites.
- **Migration timestamp convention**: as of v0.7.0 the head
  migration is `20260702000000_drop_dead_file_indexes.sql`, and
  `20260701000000_content_search_index.sql` already exists (the
  Tantivy index). D0's migration becomes `20260801000000_drives.sql`
  (or whatever date D0 actually starts) — the original
  `20260701000000_drives.sql` slot is taken.

## Verification

Each PR carries its own verification block. The bar across all of
them: **(a)** new behaviour proven by a focused test, **(b)** the
existing Hurl + Playwright baselines still pass green (`bash
tests/api/run.sh && bash tests/webdav/run.sh && cd tests/e2e && npm
test`), **(c)** `cargo fmt && cargo clippy --all-features
--all-targets -- -D warnings` clean.

### D-Prep
- **Unit**: `role_bundle(role)` returns the expected permission set
  for each role; `roles_implying(permission)` returns the expected
  role list; round-trip a grant insert→read→compare for every role.
- **Data audit**: query `access_grants` and confirm that >99% of
  rows cluster into the standard bundles (the empirical figure that
  unlocked Sequence A). Log the <1% edge cases per row for review.
- **Migration round-trip**: roll forward against a populated DB →
  every prior `access_grants` row is represented by exactly one
  `role_grants` row → roll back → original `access_grants` rows
  recovered byte-identically.
- **API**: new Hurl test `tests/api/role_grants.hurl` —
  - `POST /api/grants` with `role='editor'` creates a single row
    with the expected bundle when expanded.
  - `PUT /api/grants/{id}` with `role='viewer'` is atomic (no race
    window where the user has zero permissions).
  - Compat shim: `POST /api/grants` with the legacy `permission`
    field still works for one release and maps to the closest role.
  - Audit log emits `role_grant.created`, `role_grant.role_changed`,
    `role_grant.revoked` events with the role name carried through.
- **UI smoke (Playwright)**: My Shares dialog renders roles instead
  of permission checkboxes; share modal preset buttons map to roles;
  changing a member's role from editor → viewer fires exactly one
  PATCH and the UI reflects the change without a race-window blank
  state.
- **All existing Hurl + WebDAV + Playwright tests still pass** — the
  refactor must be invisible to every non-grant-handling test.

### D0
- **Unit**: `Drive` entity (kind + `default_for_user` CHECK
  constraints), `default_for_user` partial unique index. Personal-
  drive `add_member` / `remove_member` / `delete_drive` all refuse
  cleanly with the expected `DomainError`.
- **Migration round-trip**: roll forward against a populated DB →
  every existing folder/file row has `drive_id` set (no NULLs);
  every user has exactly one drive with `default_for_user` set;
  sibling root folders became secondary `kind='personal'` drives;
  every `storage.folders.path` and `storage.files.path` value has
  the `My Folder - <username>/` prefix stripped → roll back via
  `sqlx migrate revert` → `drive_id` column gone, `user_id` intact
  thanks to dual-write, original paths recovered.
- **Storage check**: post-migration `bash tests/api/storage_cleanup_check.sh`
  still reports a clean tree (no orphans).
- **Tantivy reindex**: every indexed doc carries a `drive_id`;
  search query filtered by `drive_id ∈ caller's drives` returns the
  expected hits; cross-drive isolation confirmed (search as Alice,
  Bob's content never appears).
- **API**: `tests/api/drives_foundation.hurl` — admin lists
  `/api/drives`, sees their default personal drive with the correct
  quota, `kind='personal'`, `default_for_user` matching their own
  uuid. Creating a folder still works; the folder's `drive_id`
  matches the personal drive.
- **All upload paths set `drive_id`**: targeted Hurl tests for
  multipart, native chunked, NC chunked, delta upload, instant
  upload by hash. Each verifies the resulting file row has the
  expected `drive_id`.

### D1
- **Routing**: `cargo build` clean; WebDAV dispatcher routes
  `/webdav/drives/<uuid>/...` correctly; `/webdav/<path>` still
  resolves to the caller's default drive (back-compat).
- **NC client back-compat**: a real NC sync client pointed at
  `/remote.php/dav/files/admin/` continues syncing the user's default
  personal drive without reconfiguration. The chroot POC's `~`
  username (or app-password binding) lands a sync into the chosen
  drive transparently.
- **Manual smoke**: open `/`, get redirected to
  `/drive/<default-uuid>`. Click sidebar drive switcher → URL
  updates, listing reloads. Drive picker shows all of the caller's
  drives (default first), each with its quota usage.
- **Playwright**: a new `tests/e2e/drive-switching.spec.ts` exercises
  sidebar → URL → listing → cross-drive isolation (folders in
  drive A don't appear in drive B's listing).

### D2
- **Membership API**: `POST /api/drives/{id}/members` with user, with
  group, and with role changes; refuses on personal drives;
  shared-drive last-owner protection. Group expansion (transitive
  members count toward the owner total).
- **Trash per drive**: trash listing scopes correctly to drive(s)
  the caller can read; mutations refuse without owner role; the
  `storage.trash_items` VIEW surfaces `drive_id`.
- **Updated NC + WebDAV regression baselines** — the 105+ scenarios
  in `BASELINE_TESTS_NC_WEBDAV.md` still pass green; per-drive
  trash and membership changes don't regress existing protocol
  behaviour.

### D3–D7
- Per-PR verification authored when the PR is drafted. Each PR adds
  at least one new Hurl/Playwright test for the headline capability
  and proves zero regression on the previous baselines.

### Cross-cutting regression — runs on every Drive PR

A standing checklist independent of the headline capability of each
PR:

1. `bash tests/api/run.sh` green (>100 scenarios).
2. `bash tests/webdav/run.sh` green (NC + native WebDAV baselines).
3. `cd tests/e2e && npm test` green (Playwright).
4. `tests/api/storage_cleanup_check.sh` clean.
5. No new `cargo clippy` warnings.
6. Tantivy index returns no cross-drive results for any caller.
7. `/api/dedup/stats` shows blob ref-counts consistent with the
   number of files referencing each blob across all drives.

## UI design — outline for D1 and D3

The Drive concept reshapes three load-bearing UI elements. Each
gets a small design pass alongside the relevant PR — the bullets
here lock the **intended shape**; the pixel work happens when D1 /
D3 draft.

### Sidebar — drives as children of a "Drive" section

Today the sidebar shows a single root view (the user's home
folder). Post-Drive it gains a top-level **Drive** section whose
children are the drives the caller has access to:

```
📁 Drive
  ⭐ Personal                ← kind='personal', default_for_user=caller  (★ marks default)
     Family Archive          ← kind='personal', secondary (no star)
     Engineering             ← kind='shared',  caller is owner/editor/viewer
     2025 Marketing Sprint   ← kind='shared'
  Recent
  Favorites
  Shared with me
  Trash
```

- The user's **default personal drive** is marked with a star (or
  bolded — UI choice). Clicking it lands on the default landing
  view (today's "Files" experience).
- Other drives — secondary personals, shared drives — appear below
  with the same visual weight. Clicking switches the context (URL
  changes to `/drive/<uuid>/...`, listing reloads).
- The sidebar is collapsible per-drive; users with many drives can
  hide the drives they aren't actively in.
- **No drive icons / colours in v1** (deferred to a future polish
  PR — see "Out of scope" item 5).
- The "Drive" section header itself is non-interactive (just a
  grouping label); the action affordance is "Create shared drive"
  via the `+` button at the end of the list (admin / group-owner
  scoped; lands in D3).

### Breadcrumb — drive-rooted

Today's breadcrumb is path-rooted: `Home / Docs / Q3 / Report.pdf`.
Post-Drive the breadcrumb starts at the selected drive:

```
[Personal ▾] / Docs / Q3 / Report.pdf
```

- The drive name is the **first** element. Clicking it returns to
  that drive's root listing.
- The `▾` chevron next to the drive name opens a quick-switcher
  picker (same list as the sidebar). Lets users jump between drives
  without using the sidebar.
- For paths inside shared drives, the drive name still leads:
  `[Engineering ▾] / Specs / Q3 OKRs.md`.
- The breadcrumb's overflow / truncation behaviour for deep paths is
  unchanged from today — only the root element is new.
- **Drive name follows server-side rename** — the breadcrumb queries
  the drive's current `name`; renaming the drive updates the
  breadcrumb on next reload without any client-side cache work.

### "Owners" section — review and redesign

Today's UI has an "Owner" surface in several places (file details
sidebar, share dialog, folder properties). It currently shows "the
user who owns this file" — a single name.

Post-Drive, ownership has multiple shapes:

- For a file in a personal drive: still one owner (the drive's sole
  user-owner). Display stays the same — "Owner: Ed".
- For a file in a shared drive: ownership is the drive's **owner-
  role members** (possibly multiple users + groups). Display
  becomes "Owner: Engineering team (3 members + 2 groups)".
- For a drive itself (when displayed in a settings view): same as
  above, but in a list form: "Owners: Ed, Alice, Engineering
  group".

Open questions for the D3 PR to settle:
- **Show the drive name as the effective owner?** "Owner:
  Engineering" reads cleanly but conflates "the drive" with "the
  drive's owners" — clearer for end users, less precise.
- **Should the file details sidebar expand owners on click?**
  Click "Engineering team" → see the owner roster. Useful for
  large drives where the owner list doesn't fit inline.
- **Audit/My Shares dialog**: the "Shared with me" view currently
  groups by sharer. Post-Drive it can group by drive instead
  (your shared-drive access shows once per drive, not once per
  file). UX win — decide which grouping is default and whether
  both are togglable.

These three UI surfaces are independent enough that they can ship
in separate PRs (sidebar in D1, breadcrumb in D1, owners review
in D3 alongside the create-shared-drive flow). The sidebar and
breadcrumb are essentially mechanical given the new model; the
owners review is the only one with genuine design questions.

## Glossary (for the next reader)

- **Drive** — a top-level container that owns folders and files.
- **Personal drive** — the auto-created drive a user gets at
  registration. One per internal user. `kind='personal'`.
- **Shared drive** — a drive whose membership includes at least one
  group (or multiple users). `kind='shared'`.
- **Drive member** — a row in `storage.role_grants` with
  `resource_type='drive'`, carrying a subject (user or group)
  and a role. There is **no** separate `drive_members` table — see
  the D-Prep prerequisite at the top of this plan for the storage
  pivot.
- **Owner / editor / viewer** — drive roles. Map to ReBAC
  permission bundles for resources inside the drive.
- **Drive policy** — JSONB key on the drive that toggles a sharing /
  movement restriction.
- **Drive context** in WebDAV — the drive whose root the request is
  rooted at. Native WebDAV resolves it from the URL prefix
  (`/webdav/<path>` → caller's personal drive,
  `/webdav/drives/<uuid>/<path>` → explicit drive). NC resolves
  it from the credential (Basic Auth `{user}~{uuid}` username, or
  the `auth.app_passwords.drive_id` binding — see §9).
- **Wrapper folder** — historical name for
  `My Folder - <username>`, the folder created at registration
  via `format!("My Folder - {}", username)`. **Retired** in the
  Drive migration: drive root replaces it. Every reference to
  "wrapper" in older comments / docs is by definition pre-Drive.
