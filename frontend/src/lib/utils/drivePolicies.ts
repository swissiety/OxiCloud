 *   - Admin "Manage policies" modal (`routes/admin/+page.svelte`) — read+write.
 *   - Drive settings page (`routes/config/drive/[uuid]/+page.svelte`) — read-only,
 *     so drive members can see which policies an admin has set.
 *
 * Kept in a plain `.ts` module (not a component) so both consumers import the
 * same array and the definition of "one policy" lives in exactly one place.
 * Adding a sixth policy is a single push here + one migration + the

 * `docs/plan/drive.md` §8 (forbid_* gates) + §15 (include_in_*_index scope).
