//! Per-request NextCloud session context.
//!
//! Bundles WHO the caller is, the raw wire username they presented,
//! and (for path-scoped endpoints) WHERE they're confined to. Built
//! by `basic_auth_middleware` and stashed in request extensions as
//! `Arc<NcSession>`; handlers extract it via [`SharedNcSession`]
//! (derefs to `NcSession`) — declare `session: SharedNcSession` in
//! the signature.
//!
//! ## Source of truth
//!
//! - `user`: authenticated identity (id, canonical username, role).
//! - `raw_username`: the opaque wire identifier from the Basic Auth
//!   header. Today: plain `user` (single-drive) or `user~{drive_uuid}`
//!   (multi-drive POC). May look different again when future auth
//!   schemes land. **Handlers MUST NOT parse it** — it's used verbatim
//!   only for echoing back into DAV/OCS URLs the client expects to
//!   see (notably OCS `cloud/user`'s `id` field, which NC desktop
//!   splices into every subsequent DAV path it builds) and for
//!   audit logs.
//! - `chroot`: folder the request is jailed inside. `Some` for every
//!   authenticated NC request today (the home folder when no drive
//!   marker is present, or the resolved drive when one is). `None`
//!   is reserved for future routes that don't operate on a single
//!   folder (admin / cross-drive queries).
//!
//! ## Why this lives in middleware, not routes.rs
//!
//! The auth step already has every input needed (raw username from
//! header + drive marker after `~` + authenticated user). Resolving
//! the chroot there means every NC handler — DAV, OCS, uploads,
//! trashbin, sharees, … — gets a uniform `NcSession` regardless of
//! whether its URL carries a `{user}` segment. The URL `{user}`
//! segment becomes informational; the auth header is canonical.
