//! Domain persistence port for the Folder entity.

//! Defines the contract that any folder storage implementation
//! must fulfill. This trait lives in the domain because Folder is a core entity
//! of the system and its persistence contracts belong to the domain layer,
//! following the principles of Clean/Hexagonal Architecture.
//!
//! Concrete implementations (filesystem, PostgreSQL, S3, etc.) live in
//! the infrastructure layer.

// NOTE on `caller_role` for the two listing methods below:
// We deliberately do NOT compute or return the caller's role per row.
// The frontend already fetches `/api/drives` (which surfaces
// `caller_role` per drive) and cross-references by `folder.drive_id` —
// see `MoveDialog.svelte` and the config/drive page. Adding
// `caller_role` to `FolderDto` would either (a) mean redundant
// server-side work for a client-side concern the client already
// handles, or (b) drag folder-level grant cascades into the query
// which is real cost for a rare edge case. Punted; see
// `project_caller_role_on_file_folder_dto` memory.
