//! Recording side of [`ResourceAccessHook`] — turns a successful file access
//! into a row in `auth.user_recent_files` via [`RecentService`].
//!
//! Wiring lives in `common/di.rs`: this hook is registered once, every
//! `_with_perms` file method on `FileRetrievalService` / `FileManagementService`
//! fans through it, and any future read-path or write-path service can opt in
//! by holding an `Option<Arc<dyn ResourceAccessHook>>` and calling
//! `on_file_accessed` after authZ.
//!
//! Two non-obvious behaviours, with rationale:
//!
//! * **Per-(caller, file) 60-second throttle.** Range-stream downloads send
//!   one GET per chunk (NC desktop, video seek, resumable transfers); without
//!   throttling each chunk would trigger an upsert against the same row.
//!   Moka's `time_to_live` gives us bounded memory and lock-free reads. The
//!   underlying `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE accessed_at = now()` is
//!   idempotent, so the rare TOCTOU window between `contains_key` and `insert`
//!   is harmless — at worst we record twice for the same instant.
//!
//! * **Fire-and-forget via `tokio::spawn`.** The `ResourceAccessHook` method
//!   is synchronous by contract (every `with_perms` caller would otherwise
//!   have to `await` the side-effect). The spawn lets the user-facing
//!   response return immediately; a DB hiccup in Recent recording never
//!   bubbles up to the GET / PUT that triggered it. Failures log at warn.
